# Authentication

### About Authentication
Working authentication service using passport, bcrypt, and express-sessions.

### Things to do
[x] Add calls to DB for user info\
[x] Research tokens and sessions -- find an npm package that seems easy enough to figure out in a day\
[>] Create Login and Signup screens\
[] Figure out React Router -- see if it's better to use protected routes or hacky 'conditional rendering' solution instead\
[] Local testing
[] Landing page styling and prep for other microservices
