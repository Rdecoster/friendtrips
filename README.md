# Authentication

### About Authentication
This is a laughably basic login/signup flow with server.  Currently, working on setting up open and protected routes, and preparing to use actual user records (from our db) to 'authenticate' logins

### Things to do
[] Add calls to DB for user info\
[] Research tokens and sessions -- find an npm package that seems easy enough to figure out in a day\
[] Create Login and Signup screens\
[] Local testing
